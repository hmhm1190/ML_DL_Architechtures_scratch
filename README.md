# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Handwritten Digits Classification

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the classification of handwritten digits. The chosen dataset for this task is the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, which comprises 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### What is MLP?

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of Artificial Neural Network(ANN) that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. MLPs are well-suited for a variety of machine learning tasks, including classification.

### Why MLP for Handwritten Digits Classification?

1. **Non-Linearity Handling:** MLPs are capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships in data. Handwritten digits can exhibit intricate patterns that may require a model with non-linear activation functions and multiple layers to recognize.

2. **Flexibility:** MLPs offer flexibility in model architecture, allowing the inclusion of multiple hidden layers and adjustable neuron counts. This adaptability is beneficial for learning hierarchical features in the dataset.

3. **Universal Approximator:** MLPs, in theory, can approximate any function, making them powerful function approximators. This property is advantageous for learning and representing the mapping from input images to digit labels.

## Dataset: Handwritten Digits

### About the Digits Dataset

The Digits dataset consists of 1,797 8x8 images of handwritten digits, with each digit labeled from 0 to 9. Each image is represented as an 8x8 matrix of pixel values, and the task is to classify each image into one of the ten digit classes.

### Why Digits Dataset?

1. **Standard Benchmark:** The Digits dataset is a well-known and standard benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It is commonly used for testing and comparing the performance of various classification algorithms.

2. **Real-World Relevance:** Handwritten digit classification is a fundamental problem with applications in optical character recognition (OCR) systems, postal services, and digit recognition in various forms.

## Evaluation and Comparison

### Model Evaluation: Accuracy

The performance of the MLP model is evaluated using accuracy, calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances in the test set.

```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy on the test set: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```
## MLP vs. Other Architectures

While MLPs are effective for handwritten digit classification, it's essential to note that other architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are also commonly used for image classification tasks. CNNs, with their ability to capture spatial hierarchies, might offer superior performance for image-related tasks.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this repository provides an implementation of an MLP for handwritten digit classification using the Digits dataset. MLPs are suitable for capturing complex patterns in the data, and their flexibility makes them a valuable choice for various classification tasks. However, depending on the complexity of the task, other architectures like CNNs may be considered for potential improvements in performance.
