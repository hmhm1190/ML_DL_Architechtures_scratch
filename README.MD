## Introduction

A curated list of ML and DL architectures, providing brief descriptions and references for each. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource that can help researchers, students, and practitioners quickly access information about various models.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and use the architectures provided here in your projects. If you have an architecture you'd like to add or have suggestions for improvement, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Architectures

Here is a list of some of the architectures included in this repository:

1. **[MLP](Deep-Learning-Architechtures-from-scratch/MLP/README.md)**: Brief description and references.
2. **[Decision_Tree](Deep-Learning-Architechtures-from-scratch/decision_tree/README.MD)**

## Usage

To use the architectures in your projects, follow the instructions provided in each architecture's respective markdown file. Additionally, you can explore the code snippets, implementation details, and references to external resources.
